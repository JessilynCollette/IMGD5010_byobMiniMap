# Build your own binary Mini Map
This project is a hypothetical 4-bit programming interface allowing the user to create their very own mini map with the given assets. 

## How to get started (See image below for more details)
1. Choose an object to place.
1. Choose a transformation to apply to the object chosen.
1. Choose a spot for the placement of the object on the 4 x 4 grid.

## The Process
### Choose the binary encoding for the asset you are planning on placing on the grid.
