# Build your own binary Mini Map
This project is a hypothetical 4-bit programming interface allowing the user to create their very own mini map with the given assets. 

## How to get started (See images below for more details)
1. Choose an object to place.
1. Choose a transformation to apply to the object chosen.
1. Choose a spot for the placement of the object on the 4 x 4 grid.

## The Process
### Choose the binary encoding for the object you are planning on placing on the grid.

### Choose the binary encoding for the transformation you would like to apply to the object chosen.

### Choose the binary encoding for the square on the grid where you would like to place the object.

The binary for the top row in this mini map example is : (0010, 0000, 0000), (0000, 0010, 0001), (0111, 0011, 0010), (1000, 0010, 0011)
(Object, Transformation, Placement)

## Challenge
### Draw a simple map with some trees, a pond, and a path leading to some treasure (X marks the spot!)
