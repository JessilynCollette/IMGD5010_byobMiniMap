Improvements:
a. If we have some explanations for the graph, that would be better, like what those 3
gray dots stand for. what is the term of those graphs
b. In the Transform section, there are only six sections. You can just use 3-bit numbers
to represent those. I mean, the 4-bit number also works. This could save some resources
in the real-life problem. For this project, I love the different combinations between objects. You have different
ways to form a path to the treasure spot. Itâ€™s so much fun. You can draw your own
pictures by hand, that reminds me of the painting game during my childhood.
